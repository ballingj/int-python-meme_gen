# Meme Generator

## Overview
Meme Generator Aapplication â€“ a multimedia application to dynamically generate memes from a stock image and stock quotes.
There also includes an option to supply a custom image and custom quotes. 

This is the second project in the course Intermediate Python Nanodegree by Udacity

There are two ways to generate a meme:
1) Via CLI module called main.py, or
2) Via a web browser

Within the CLI or Web app, you can generate a random meme or create a custom meme

## Setup
You will need some third party modules to make the program work:

```
pip install pandas
pip install -U setuptools
pip install python-docx
pip install requests
pip install Pillow
pip install flask -U
```

You will also need to install a third party application xpdf to parse a PDF document:

Windows: download from https://www.xpdfreader.com/download.html

Linux: 
```
sudo apt-get install -y xpdf
```
Mac: 
```
brew install xpdf
```
## Modules
Here are some brief description of the roles-and-responsibilities of the sub-modules including dependencies and examples of how to use the module

##### MemeEngine
This module contains the main engine MemeGenerator.py that combines an image, and the quote texts to generate the finished Meme.  This module is a background processes and not meant to interface the user.
Third party modules required are the following:
- Pillow for image manipulations


##### QuoteEngine
QuoteEngine contains the modules that parses the quotes to be embedded into an image before the meme can be generated.  This modules are background processes and not meant to interface the user.
Third party modules required are the following:
- pandas - for csv
- setuptools - Python helper module to help with MS word parsing
- python-docx - for MS word parsing
- xpdf program installed appropriate for your OS


##### App.py
This is the Web interface of the MemeGenerator.  This module is responsible for interfacing with Flask to generate the HTML interface used to create the meme.
Third party modules required are the following:
- requests - for saving image files from the internet when creating custom meme
- Flask - for generating the web application


##### main.py
This is the CLI version of the MemeGenerator.  This module uses an argument parser to allow the user to pass three optional arguments to create a custom meme.  The default is to pass no arguments, and the application will generate a random meme from stock photos and quotes.  Example usage:
Generate a random meme
```
python main.py
```
Help:
```
python main.py -h
```
Output:
```
usage: main.py [-h] [--path PATH] [--body BODY] [--author AUTHOR]

Create a random meme

options:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --path PATH      path to an image file
  --body BODY      quote body to add to the image
  --author AUTHOR  quote author to add to the image
```
```
python main.py --path ./tmp/some_photo.jpg --body "Hello World!" --author "Shakespere"
```
